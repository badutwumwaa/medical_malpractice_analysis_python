Inferential statistics with python scripts for the medical malpractice claims dataset

"According to a recent study published in the US News and World Report the cost of medical malpractice in the United States is $55.6 billion a year, which is 2.4 percent of annual health-care spending. Another 2011 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that annually, during the period 1991 to 2005, 7.4% of all physicians licensed in the US had a malpractice claim. These staggering numbers not only contribute to the high cost of health care, but the size of successful malpractice claims also contributes to high premiums for medical malpractice insurance.
The data set contains information about the last 79210 claim payments made.
•	Amount - Amount of the claim payment in dollars
•	Severity - The severity rating of damage to the patient, from 1 (emotional trauma) to 9 (death)
•	Age - Age of the claimant in years
•	Private Attorney - Whether the claimant was represented by a private attorney.
•	Marital Status - Marital status of the claimant
•	Specialty - Specialty of the physician involved in the lawsuit.
•	Insurance - Type of medical insurance carried by the patient.
•	Gender - Patient Gender"

**Project Title:** Medical Malpractice Data Analysis

**1. Project Overview:**
   The "Medical Malpractice Inferential Data Analysis with Python" project aims to utilize inferential statistics in Python for a comprehensive analysis of the "medical_malpractice" dataset. The goal is to derive meaningful insights, enabling informed decision-making. The project's findings will be effectively communicated through Microsoft PowerPoint presentations.

**2. Project Objectives:**
   - Conduct inferential statistical analysis on the medical malpractice dataset using Python.
   - Replace traditional descriptive statistics with Python-based inferential statistical methods.
   - Utilize Microsoft PowerPoint for visually compelling presentations of inferential insights.

**3. Scope of Work:**
   - **Data Extraction and Preparation:**
     - Extract data directly from the "medical_malpractice" dataset.
     - Use Python for data preprocessing, ensuring it is conducive to inferential statistical analysis.
   - **Python Inferential Analysis:**
     - Develop Python scripts for inferential statistical tests, hypothesis testing, and drawing meaningful conclusions.
     - Utilize statistical libraries to explore relationships, dependencies, and patterns within the medical malpractice data.
   - **Visualization in PowerPoint:**
     - Generate visually appealing PowerPoint slides presenting inferential statistical findings.
     - Utilize Python-based visualizations to enhance the interpretability of statistical results.
   - **Business Questions:**
     - Formulate Python scripts to address specific business questions through inferential statistical methods.

**4. Project Deliverables:**
   - Python scripts showcasing inferential statistical analyses.
   - PowerPoint slides containing visually rich inferential visualizations and summaries.
   - Project documentation encompassing insights, methodologies, and recommendations based on inferential statistics.

**5. Constraints:**
   - The project's scope is contingent on the available dataset and its quality.
   - Address unforeseen technical challenges related to data extraction or analysis promptly during the project's execution.
